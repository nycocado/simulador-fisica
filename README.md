## About

Particle simulator with two independent modes. In kinematic mode particles follow constant-acceleration trajectories; in dynamic mode Newton's second law is applied with configurable forces and gravity. The UI is built with GTK4 and Blueprint, and simulations are rendered with Cairo.

## Simulation modes

| Mode          | Description                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinematic** | Constant acceleration — position and velocity updated via s = s₀ + v·t + ½·a·t².          |
| **Dynamic**   | Variable acceleration — resultant force divided by mass yields acceleration at each step. |

## Features

- **Vector graphics**: Render particles, velocities, and forces with magnitudes and directions using Cairo.
- **Simulation playback**: Start, stop, and restart simulations with configurable time steps, frames per second, total duration, and gravity.
- **Camera controls**:
  - **Auto-zoom**: Dynamically scales the viewport to fit all active particles.
  - **Follow particle**: Tracks a specific particle, keeping it centered.
- **Particle trails**: Renders the historical path of particles.
- **Data export**: Automatically saves detailed simulation logs to CSV files containing positions, velocities, and forces for each particle over time.
- **Project management**: Save and load simulation states as `.sabino` project files.
